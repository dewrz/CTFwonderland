# CTFwonderland

This CTF focused on compromising a Linux-based system. It was a bit more involved than the previous CTF I had posted here. While completing this task, I did reference <a href="https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-hardening/privilege-escalation">HackTricks.xyz</a> (which is a treasure trove of information) and <a href="https://gtfobins.github.io/">GTFOBins</a>. I use both of those sites quite often to help guide me in my process. I often download Linpeas to the machine I'm attacking for efficiency when searching for angles that I can exploit to gain privilege escalation, but recently I've been trying to approach this by manually searching. It takes much longer, but because of my novice pentesting skills, I believe by doing this manually it will help bolster those skills through repetition and solidify my understanding of those approaches.
